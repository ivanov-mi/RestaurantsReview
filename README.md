# Restaurants Review Demo App

  Recruitment task for iOS job application.

## Requirements
- User must be able to create an account and log in. (this means that more users can use the app from the same phone).
- Implement 2 roles with different permission levels
  - Regular User: Can rate and leave a comment for a restaurant
  - Admin: Can add/edit/delete, restaurants, users and reviews
- Reviews should have:
  - A 5 star based rate
  - Date of the visit
  - Comment
- When a Regular User logs in he will see a Restaurant List ordered by Rate Average
- When a restaurant is selected, a detailed view should be presented showing:
  - The overall average rating
  - The highest rated review
  - The lowest rated review
  - Latest review showing with rate and comment
- Functional UI design is needed. You are not required to create a unique design, however, do follow best practices to make the project as functional as possible.
